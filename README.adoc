= Hodei Starter JWT

Auto-configurable Spring Boot module that includes web security configuration to perform
authentication and/or authorization based on JWT tokens.

== Configuration

Example of configuration for an application that only requires authorization:

----
app:
  security:
    jwt:
      secret: ${APP_JWT_SECRET:changeit}
      expiration: 18000
      alternate-header: X-Authorization
    authentication:
      enabled: false
      path: /token
    authorization:
      enabled: true
    unsecured:
      paths: >-
        /,
        /v3/api-docs,
        /v3/api-docs/**,
        /swagger-ui/**,
        /swagger-ui.html,
        /swagger-resources/**,
        /webjars/**,
        /actuator,
        /actuator/**
----

In the case that the standard Authorization header is used by another system before the invocation
of our application we have the option to set the name of the alternative header through the
`alternate-header` property.

The token expiration value is expressed in minutes.
